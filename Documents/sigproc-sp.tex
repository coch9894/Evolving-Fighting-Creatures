\begin{abstract}

An essential part of any genetic program is the use of a well defined fitness function that produces the desired outputs. For competitive co-evolution this does not change however, the ability to view the affects of different fitness functions on two simultaneously evolving populations can be seen through competition. Through competition, the value of a good fitness function will become apparent from the winner of the competition. We propose that it is possible to see the affects of different fitness functions through control of an individuals fitness which then can be normalized to compare to other individuals fitnesses in the population.

\section{Introduction} % Include Papers here



\section{The Experiment} % BODY

The simplest way to test our hypothesis was to build a genetic program that could be used in conjuncture with a graphics engine so our end results could be shown and quantified. To do so we built a genetic program that would evolve the instructions for an individual. To evaluate these individuals with different fitness functions it seemed best to use the idea of training two populations on separate fitness functions and then testing them against each other at regular intervals to get a grasp on the validity of each fitness function. After each generation, the best individual from \textit{either} population was saved into a separate population as a control group. When evolution ended, the best individual was tested against this control group to check for the Red Queen Effect. This allowed us to observe if we were creating a overall best solution or if we were cycling through a few strategies.

\subsection{Individuals} % What makes an individual
Our individuals were made up of common and new behaviours that we needed to model our creatures. The following list of Non-Terminals and Terminals is all we used to make up our individual. Evolution was the key to setting them in the correct order and will be covered in the next section.
\begin{itemize}
\item Non-Terminals
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Prog2 - When called during evaluation, pushes its left child, then its right child onto the correct player stack.
	\item Prog3 - When called during evaluation, pushes its left child, middle child, then its right child onto the correct player stack.
	\end{itemize}
\item Terminals
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Move - When called during evaluation, moves the correct players x position by cos(this->direction)*speed + 0.5 where the direction is where the player is facing. Also moves the correct players y position by sin(this->direction)*speed + 0.5.
	\item Turn Left - When called during evaluation, computes this->direction += BASE\_ANGLE which changes the direction the player is facing.
	\item Turn Right - When called during evaluation, computes this->direction -= BASE\_ANGLE which changes the direction the player is facing.
	\item Aim - When called during evaluation, computes the angle to turn by using the current position of both players and the arc-tangent. In other words, we set the angle to turn to be atan( (y2-y1)/(x2-x1) ).
	\item Shoot - When called during evaluation, adds a new bullet to the environment list containing environment variables.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fitness \& Other Algorithms} % Fitness etc.

To keep the fitnesses simple we decided to keep track the number of times an individual hit the opponent and the number of times that an opponent hit the individual. These were the numbers that our fitness functions would try to control. For example we might want to try and maximize the number of successful hits of the opponent and maximize the number of times the opponent hits the individual. In theory this doesn't sound like that great of a strategy but maybe against some other fitness function it would be great.

When we would like to compare the different functions however we needed some way to standardize these fitnesses. We came up with what we viewed as a perfect fitness and created a normalizing function to use the two prior values to represent it. Therefore our fitness functions are really controlling methods and strategies for getting the highest normalized fitness. The following is pseudo code for our normalization function:
\begin{verbatim}
    if(this->numSuccess == this->numFail)
    {
        this->fitness = 1;
    }
    else
    {
        if(this->numFail == 0){
            this->numFail += 0.01;
        }
        this->fitness = numSuccess/numFail;
    }
\end{verbatim}
Because we decided to use a division of Success/Failures, we had to account for 0 in the denominator. Therefore if the Successes=Failures we just set our "stalemate" value or "average" outcome at 1. Therefore anything over 1 is assumed to be above average during the division. If the denominator is 0 and the numerator is not, we take this as an exceptionally good individual and wish to divide by 0.01 which essentially multiplies our answer by 100.

\subsubsection{Turning Logic} % Our Turn_Left and Turn_Right Logic

When training or testing to obtain fitness, it is unknown which side of the board the individual will be on or if they will always be on the same side of the board. To compensate for this, when a player is designated to be Player1, a turn\_left action will cause them to rotate their facing direction in a positive direction and a turn\_right action will cause them to rotate their facing direction in a negative direction. However, when a player is designated as Player2, a turn\_left action will cause them to rotate their facing direction in a negative direction and a turn\_right action will cause them to rotate their facing direction in a positive direction. This removes any chance of an individual evolving a strategy for only one side of the board. This will help create a universal strategy.

\subsection{Tables}
Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best
placement for them is typically the top of the page
nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go
in the \textbf{tabular} environment, to
be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired
horizontal and vertical rules.  Again, detailed instructions
on \textbf{tabular} material
is found in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table 1 is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed
dvi output of this document.

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\ \hline
\O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\ \hline
$\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\ \hline
\$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\ \hline
$\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
\hline\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of
the page's live area, use the environment
\textbf{table*} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this wide
table will ``float" to a location deemed more desirable.
Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table 2 is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the
table here with the table in the printed dvi
output of this document.


\begin{table*}
\centering
\caption{Some Typical Commands}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
Command&A Number&Comments\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}alignauthor} & 100& Author alignment\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}numberofauthors}& 200& Author enumeration\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\ \hline\end{tabular}
\end{table*}
% end the environment with {table*}, NOTE not {table}!

\subsection{Figures}
Like tables, figures cannot be split across pages; the
best placement for them
is typically the top or the bottom of the page nearest
their initial cite.  To ensure this proper ``floating'' placement
of figures, use the environment
\textbf{figure} to enclose the figure and its caption.

This sample document contains examples of \textbf{.eps}
and \textbf{.ps} files to be displayable with \LaTeX.  More
details on each of these is found in the \textit{Author's Guide}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\epsfig{file=fly.eps}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic (.eps format).}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\epsfig{file=fly.eps, height=1in, width=1in}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic (.eps format)
that has been resized with the \texttt{epsfig} command.}
\end{figure}


As was the case with tables, you may want a figure
that spans two columns.  To do this, and still to
ensure proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the environment
\textbf{figure*} to enclose the figure and its caption.

Note that either {\textbf{.ps}} or {\textbf{.eps}} formats are
used; use
the \texttt{{\char'134}epsfig} or \texttt{{\char'134}psfig}
commands as appropriate for the different file types.

\subsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
Other common constructs that may occur in your article are
the forms for logical constructs like theorems, axioms,
corollaries and proofs.  There are
two forms, one produced by the
command \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} and the
other by the command \texttt{{\char'134}newdef}; perhaps
the clearest and easiest way to distinguish them is
to compare the two in the output of this sample document:

This uses the \textbf{theorem} environment, created by
the\linebreak\texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} command:
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
\begin{theorem}
Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$.  If $G$ is
an antiderivative for $f$ on $[a,b]$, then
\begin{displaymath}\int^b_af(t)dt = G(b) - G(a).\end{displaymath}
\end{theorem}

The other uses the \textbf{definition} environment, created
by the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command:
\newdef{definition}{Definition}
\begin{definition}
If $z$ is irrational, then by $e^z$ we mean the
unique number which has
logarithm $z$: \begin{displaymath}{\log e^z = z}\end{displaymath}
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\psfig{file=rosette.ps, height=1in, width=1in,}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic (.ps format) that has
been resized with the \texttt{psfig} command.}
\end{figure}

Two lists of constructs that use one of these
forms is given in the
\textit{Author's  Guidelines}.

\begin{figure*}
\centering
\epsfig{file=flies.eps}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic (.eps format)
that needs to span two columns of text.}
\end{figure*}
and don't forget to end the environment with
{figure*}, not {figure}!
 
There is one other similar construct environment, which is
already set up
for you; i.e. you must \textit{not} use
a \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to
create it: the \textbf{proof} environment.  Here
is a example of its use:
\begin{proof}
Suppose on the contrary there exists a real number $L$ such that
\begin{displaymath}
\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L.
\end{displaymath}
Then
\begin{displaymath}
l=\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)
= \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\left[ g{x} \cdot \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right ]
= \lim_{x\rightarrow c} g(x) \cdot \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0\cdot L = 0,
\end{displaymath}
which contradicts our assumption that $l\neq 0$.
\end{proof}

Complete rules about using these environments and using the
two different creation commands are in the
\textit{Author's Guide}; please consult it for more
detailed instructions.  If you need to use another construct,
not listed therein, which you want to have the same
formatting as the Theorem
or the Definition\cite{salas:calculus} shown above,
use the \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} or the
\texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command,
respectively, to create it.

\section{Headings in Appendices}
The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for
the body of the article are different in the appendices.
In the \textbf{appendix} environment, the command
\textbf{section} is used to
indicate the start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order
designation (i.e. the first is A, the second B, etc.) and
a title (if you include one).  So, if you need
hierarchical structure
\textit{within} an Appendix, start with \textbf{subsection} as the
highest level. Here is an outline of the body of this
document in Appendix-appropriate form:
